ALMANAC.BAS - Description
=========================

Purpose:
--------
This BASIC program for SHARP PC calculates the GHA (Greenwich Hour Angle) and the declination of the Sun for a specified date and time, useful for astronomical navigation.

How it works:
-------------
1. The user enters year (1980-2099), month, day, hour, and minutes (UT).
2. The program computes the Julian Day (JD) and the fraction of a century (T) since January 1, 2000.
3. It calculates the mean positions of the Sun (longitude, mean anomaly, etc.) and the corrections for the equation of the center.
4. The apparent longitude of the Sun, the obliquity of the ecliptic, and the equatorial position (right ascension and declination) are determined.
5. The program computes the Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time (GMST) and then the GHA of the Sun.
6. It prints the date, UT time, the Sun's GHA (in degrees, minutes, seconds), and declination (N/S, degrees, minutes, seconds).
7. The user can repeat the calculation for other data.

Main variables:
---------------
- Y, M, D: year, month, day
- H, N: hour and minutes UT
- JD: Julian Day
- T: Julian century since 2000
- L0: mean longitude of the Sun
- MA: mean anomaly of the Sun
- C: equation of the center
- TL: true longitude of the Sun
- OM: longitude of the ascending node
- LA: apparent longitude of the Sun
- EP: obliquity of the ecliptic
- RA: right ascension of the Sun
- GM: Greenwich Mean Sidereal Time
- GH: GHA of the Sun
- DEC: declination of the Sun

Typical use:
------------
The program is intended for navigators, amateur astronomers, or anyone needing to know the position of the Sun relative to Greenwich at a given moment.

Notes:
------
- The calculations are approximate but sufficiently accurate for practical navigation.
- The program requires manual input and provides textual output.
