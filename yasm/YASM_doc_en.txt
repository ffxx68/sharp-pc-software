//
// 0. Overview
//

YASM61860 (hereinafter referred to as YASM) is installed in the old Sharp Pokoken.
This is an assembler for 8bit CPU SC61860. Features include:

☆ Written in perl so can run on many platforms
☆ Output a machine language dump list instead of an object file!
☆ CLOADM compliant wav files can be output! !

//
// 1. How to use
//

First of all, you will need perl ver.5 or later (probably). How to use YASM
Basically

perl yasm.pl [source]

In the case of sh, csh type shells, add execution attributes and directly run

yasm.pl [source]

(The first line of yasm.pl should be changed according to your environment.
Please edit. ) 

[source] I want to assemble with this assembler
An assembly language source file with a file name of .s or .asm
Must be finished. If not specified, read from standard input.
will be included. When the two-pass assembly is finished, unless otherwise specified,
Outputs a dump list (!) to standard output. (Check every 8 bytes
Displays up to Sam. Well, it's a lot of things!)

If you want to explicitly specify the output file, etc., please use a switch.
The format is

yasm [switches] [source]

(In the current version, [switches] and [source] are
there is no limit. ) The following switches can be used.

[switches]

   -d dumplist Save the dump list to the file specified by dumplist.
                Output. If omitted, output is to standard output.
   -w wavfile Adds CLOADM to the file specified by wavfile.
                Output wav file. No output is provided if omitted.
   -old This is a switch for older models such as PC-1245/125x. wav
                Affects only when generating files.

example)
     yasm.pl -d dump.txt -w csavem.wav source.s

2.1 Basic structure

Basically, use Sharp compliant (?) assembly language. line by line
Please write the command. The group is

Label: mnemonic operand #comment

It consists of four parts, each part separated by one or more [TAB] or spaces.
must be separated. Each can be omitted, but the order is as follows:
Must be. I will explain each one.

---- Label ----
Any string of letters and numbers. uppercase and lowercase letters
distinguish. Write the definition at the beginning of the line and add a : (colon) immediately after it.
This is done using the equ directive, which will be explained later.

---- Mnemonic ----
I made it after looking at Kogakusha's ``Introduction to Pocket Computer Machine Language'', so basically
Follow it. It doesn't matter whether it's uppercase or lowercase. undefined instruction
(Hidden commands) are also partially supported.

---- operand ----
Four arithmetic operations, parentheses, logical product (&), logical sum (|), exclusive logical sum (^),
You can use calculation formulas using shift operators (<<,>>). The priority is
It is together with the C processing system. Things that can be used as literals are decimal constants,
Hexadecimal constants (starts with $ and is not case sensitive), labels,
Character (column) constant. A character (column) constant is any string enclosed in ',
For example, for 'abc', $616263 = 6382179.
You can use \ (backslash) as an escape.
The byte order is big endian (SC61860 type is Motorola style).

Example) -$Abc + 100*(label-'\'')/ 'str\\' & $f000 >> 8

---- comment ----
Anything from # or ; to the end of the line is ignored as a comment. string constant
If you want to use these characters inside, be sure to prefix them with \.



2.2 Grammar Notes

Operand of jump command (JR* JP* LOOP) is "address to jump to"
Please write. In the case of relative jumps, instead of writing the relative value,
This is the address you want to fly to. (Of course, a label is fine.)

I couldn't think of a nice way to write the case instruction (or sett/jst instruction)
Therefore, write the operand using the db or dw pseudo-instruction.


2.3 Directives

The pseudo-instructions implemented in this version are explained in order.

---- org ----
Defines the address of that location in the assembly language source.
Cannot be labeled.

example)
org $5000 # $5000 address from here
VRAM: org $2000 # error


---- equ ----
Set the value on the label. Even if you add :(colon) to the label
You don't have to wear it.

example)
VRAM1: EQU $2000 # Even if there is a colon
VRAM2 equ VRAM+$40 # Can be omitted


---- db ----
Arrange the byte sequence. Continuously by separating with ,(comma)
It can be arranged.

example)
db 'H','e','l','l','o',',',$0c,$0d


---- dw ----
Arranges a word (=2 byte) column. Part-time order is big
It's endian.

example)
dw 'Wo','rl','d!',$0c0d,0


---- ds ----
Arranges any number of arbitrary 1 bytes consecutively. The format is
ds number of bytes [,data]. Data is optional; if omitted,
It is assumed to be 0.

example)
ds 10,$ff # fill 10 bytes with $ff
ds 20 # fill 20 bytes with 0

// 3. And many other things

The guy who somehow made it is an assembler for SC61860. Now (June 1998)
I wondered who would use it, but I guess it's fine. why did you make it
That's because I happened to get the PC-1262.

The biggest selling point of this assembler is the wav file generation.
It's probably a function. If you don't have a cassette I/F, please give it a try.
please look. In order to implement this feature, we used the "Pocket Computer Machine Language"
I looked at ``Introduction'', but I was troubled by the lack of information. In the end at O2
I recorded it and analyzed it using a waveform editor. It took a lot of effort
is.

If the program address is divided, the output wav file
The file is undefined from the lowest address to the highest address of the program.
The area will be filled with 00.

If you find any bugs, please send us a bug report. that time,
I would appreciate it if you could also attach the source where the problem occurred.

To write scripts larger than 1kb in perl, use an assembler.
This is my first experience, so I think there are some things I'm lacking in.
If you have any questions, please feel free to email me.
I'm happy.

Well, you're halfway ready for your journey back to the good old days. later
All you have to do is dig out the Pokécom from the closet and buy the CR-2032.
If you have one, we also have the ``Cassette Interface CE-124'' available.
Please. May SC61860 be with you!
